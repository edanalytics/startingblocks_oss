# StartingBlocks Management Functions
At EA we have worked with Ed-Fi for some time to manage and administer environments with a large number of tenants. As such, we have created a set of management functions that we deploy alongside the Ed-Fi API/ODS that allow for ease of environment configuration. These functions are deployed as AWS Lambda Function resources during StartingBlocks delpoyment.  We will dive into each of these functions individually and explain what they do, why they were created, and how to interface with them.
